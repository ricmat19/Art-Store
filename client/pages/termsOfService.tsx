                  <h4>a. Overview</h4>
                  <p>
                    RDCArt Marketplace (the “Marketplace”) is a Service that
                    allows you to commercialize some of Your Content (defined in
                    section 15) through the Site. There are two types of
                    products that are now, or may in the future be, available
                    for sale through the Marketplace, i.e.: Digital Products and
                    Hard Products. All of Your Content, whether it is a Digital
                    Product, Hard Product, a description of a Digital Product or
                    Hard Product, or otherwise, must comply with these Terms,
                    and Epic reserves the right to remove any of Your Content
                    that Epic determines in its sole discretion does not comply
                    with these Terms. You grant Epic rights in Your Content as
                    set out in section 16 below.
                  </p>
                  <h4>b. Digital Products</h4>
                  <p>
                    Digital Products are products such as tutorials, software
                    tools, stock assets and other electronic products that you
                    upload to the Site and make available through the
                    Marketplace. If you opt to allow any of Your Content to be
                    commercialized as Digital Products, then you agree as
                    follows:{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (i) You must set a price for each of your Digital Products.
                    You hereby authorize us to license copies of those products
                    at that price, plus applicable taxes.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (ii) You must specify the licence terms that apply to each
                    Digital Product you make available through the Marketplace.
                    You will have the option of specifying one of our standard
                    licence terms or providing your own licence terms. If you
                    provide your own license terms, we will have the right to
                    review, approve, or disapprove those terms at our discretion
                    at any time. We do not represent or warrant that any
                    documentation or information we provide complies with any
                    jurisdiction’s laws, and you should obtain advice from a
                    qualified professional before preparing or implementing any
                    terms. You acknowledge and agree that the licence terms are
                    between you and the purchaser, and that we do not have any
                    obligation to enforce those terms or to attempt to resolve
                    any dispute between you and a purchaser.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (iii) After we have completed a transaction in connection
                    with any of your Digital Products, we will make the Digital
                    Products available to the purchaser according to the
                    applicable licence terms you have specified (subject to
                    Section 10(b)(ii)). You hereby grant us a royalty-free,
                    perpetual, world-wide licence to do so. You must not include
                    anything in the Digital Products that reduces or eliminates
                    the applicable licence granted to the customer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (iv) After we have received payment for a transaction in
                    connection with any of your Digital Products, we will
                    deposit you a percentage of the price (excluding taxes) we
                    received as set out in fee schedule, less any transaction
                    fees listed in that fee schedule, into your Marketplace
                    account. You may redeem amounts from your Marketplace
                    account as described in section 10e) below. We will retain
                    the remainder as our commission for the transaction. We may
                    change the fee schedule from time-to-time by posting the
                    changes on the Site for at least 30 days.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (v) If a customer advises us that there is a material error
                    in any of your Digital Products, or that they do not
                    substantially conform with the description you provided for
                    them, or there is some other material issue with your
                    Digital Products then: (i) you will promptly remedy that
                    error, description or issue at our request, (ii) we may
                    refund the customer, in which case at our option you will
                    either repay us the refunded amount or we will deduct the
                    refunded amount from any future payment we make to you, and
                    (iii) we may suspend or prohibit future sales of Your
                    Content.
                  </p>
                  <h4>c. Hard Products</h4>
                  <p>
                    Hard Products are print-on-demand products that we may offer
                    from time to time, such as art prints, apparel and other
                    merchandise, onto which is printed Your Content that you
                    have uploaded to the Site and made available through the
                    Marketplace. If you opt to allow any of Your Content to be
                    used to produce any Hard Products, then you agree as
                    follows:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (i) You must set a mark-up for each Hard Product we sell
                    which bears that content. This mark-up will be added to the
                    price we charge for the product. You hereby authorize us to
                    sell those Hard Products bearing that content at those
                    prices plus applicable taxes.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (ii) After we have completed a transaction in connection
                    with any Hard Product bearing Your Content, we or our
                    suppliers will complete the manufacturing process by
                    printing Your Content on the product. You hereby grant us
                    and our suppliers a royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide
                    licence to do so, and to modify Your Content as necessary or
                    desirable to apply it to the product.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (iii) You acknowledge that the appearance of Your Content on
                    the products may vary in colour, quality and appearance
                    depending on the Hard Product. You can select which types of
                    Hard Products may be sold with Your Content; however, you
                    will not have the opportunity to pre-approve the appearance
                    of Your Content on those products before they are
                    manufactured and shipped to customers.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (iv) After we have received payment for a sale in connection
                    with any Hard Product bearing Your Content, we will deposit
                    into your Marketplace account the mark-up you selected for
                    that product, less any transaction fees listed in our fee
                    schedule. You may redeem amounts from your Marketplace
                    account as described in section 10(e) below. We will retain
                    the remainder as our commission for the sale. We may change
                    the above fee schedule from time-to-time by posting the
                    changes on the Site for at least 30 days.
                  </p>
                  <h4>d. Both Products</h4>
                  <p>
                    (i) You must provide a description for each item of Your
                    Content that you upload to the Site and make available for
                    purchase through the Marketplace. That description must
                    comply with these Terms. You hereby represent and warrant
                    that all such descriptions are and will be accurate,
                    complete, and not misleading, and do not and will not
                    infringe or misappropriate any third-party rights.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (ii) All of your representations, warranties and indemnities
                    relating to Your Content generally, also apply specifically
                    to Your Content in the Marketplace. In addition, you
                    represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to
                    allow Your Content to be displayed, commercialized and used
                    as described above. You are solely responsible and liable
                    for Your Content, and you indemnify Epic regarding Your
                    Content as set out in section 40.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (iii) We will not be responsible for anything a customer or
                    a third party does with Your Content, including in
                    connection with a Digital Product or a Hard Product. We have
                    no obligation to enforce the licence terms that apply to any
                    content you sell through the Marketplace, or enforcing your
                    rights in or to Your Content. If you believe a customer or
                    third party has violated any of your rights with respect to
                    any product, it will be your sole responsibility to address
                    that violation on your own, at your sole expense. Please
                    refer to section 23 below if you believe that another user
                    has posted content that infringes your rights.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (iv) If any purchaser is not satisfied with a purchased
                    Digital Product or Hard Product for any reason, we reserve
                    the right to refund the purchaser, in which case at our
                    option we will deduct the refunded amount from your
                    Marketplace account balance. If your Marketplace account
                    balance does not have enough money to cover the refund, the
                    balance can go into negative and the amounts owed can be
                    paid against future sales, or we may request that you repay
                    us the amounts owing (and you will promptly pay those
                    amounts if we so request).{" "}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (v) You will comply with any other rules or policies we post
                    on the site from time-to-time regarding the Marketplace.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <h4>e. Account Balance and Redemption</h4>
                  <p>
                    (i) Upon receiving payment from a purchase of your Digital
                    Product or Hard Product, we will deposit your portion of the
                    payment into your Marketplace account.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (ii) Provided that the balance of your Marketplace account
                    exceeds the applicable threshold set out in our fee
                    schedule, that balance will be automatically redeemed on a
                    weekly basis.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (iii) Balances that you redeem will be paid to the bank
                    account you designate on the Site. A deposit initiated by a
                    balance redemption will not reach your bank account
                    immediately.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (iv) If we have provided a refund to a purchaser of your
                    Digital Product or Hard Product we will deduct the refunded
                    amount from your Marketplace account balance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (v) You acknowledge and agree that additional third-party
                    fees may apply to and be deducted from the amounts you
                    redeem from your Marketplace account balance, and that Epic
                    is not responsible for and has no control over such fees.
                    For example, your bank may impose wire transfer or similar
                    fees or currency conversion fees.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (vi) Epic is not responsible for lost payments. You are
                    solely responsible for ensuring we have all required account
                    numbers and information to make those payments.
                  </p>
                  <h4>f. Currency Conversion</h4>
                  <p>
                    Epic will calculate and render a converted exchange rate in
                    United States dollars, regardless of the currency in which
                    you listed the price of your Digital Product or Hard
                    Product. All transactions through the Marketplace,
                    regardless of type of content or listed currency, will
                    settle in United States dollars. Your Marketplace account
                    balance will be denominated and redeemable only in United
                    States dollars. Epic cannot guarantee the accuracy of
                    displayed exchange rates because market rates can fluctuate.
                    We recommend that you confirm current exchange rates before
                    engaging in Marketplace transactions.
                  </p>
                  <h4>g. Taxes</h4>
                  <p>
                    You are solely responsible and liable for imposing,
                    collecting, reporting and remitting to the relevant
                    authorities, in a timely and proper manner, all applicable

                    withhold and other taxes, duties, charges, levies, fees,
                    excises, tariffs, and assessments of any nature whatsoever
                    imposed, arising from, connect with and relating to your
                    sales through the Marketplace and the payments you receive
                    for those sales. Epic does not and will not provide any

                  <h4>a. Overview</h4>
                  <p>
                    The Marketplace is a Service that allows you to purchase
                    products from other content providers through the Site.
                    There are two types of products that are now, or may in the
                    future be, available for purchase through the Marketplace,
                    i.e.: Digital Products and Hard Products.{" "}
                  </p>
                  <h4>b. Digital Products</h4>
                  <p>
                    Digital Products are products such as videos, software
                    tools, stock assets and other electronic products. After you
                    have completed a transaction for a Digital Product, we will
                    make a copy of the product available to you according to the
                    licence terms specified by the Digital Product’s provider.
                    You must not distribute the product, allow any third party
                    to use or access the product, or otherwise use, reproduce or
                    exploit the product in any way that is not permitted by the
                    applicable licence terms. You acknowledge and agree that
                    those licence terms (and any dispute under them) are between
                    you and the provider and that we are not a party to them and
                    that we do not have any obligation to attempt to resolve any
                    dispute between you and the provider. You also acknowledge
                    and agree that we are a third-party beneficiary of those
                    licence terms and therefore will be entitled to directly
                    enforce and rely upon any provision in those terms that
                    confers a benefit on, or rights in favour of, us.
                  </p>
                  <h4>c. Hard Products</h4>
                  <p>
                    Hard Products are print-on-demand products such as art
                    prints, apparel and other merchandise onto which the
                    applicable content is printed. After you have completed a
                    transaction for a Hard Product, we or our suppliers will
                    complete the manufacturing process and ship the product to
                    you when it is ready. We will endeavour to ship the product
                    within any estimates provided on the Site, but we will not
                    be responsible for late deliveries. Title and risk of loss
                    for the products will pass to you upon receipt of the
                    product by the carrier. We can split orders into two or more
                    shipments at our discretion and expense.{" "}

                  <h4>d. Both Products</h4>
                  <p>
                    (i) You must pay us the price listed on the Site for the
                    products, plus all applicable taxes, and (for Hard Products)
                    applicable shipping and handling.

                  <p>
                    (ii) Our Refunds and Returns policies (as amended from
                    time-to-time) set out our obligations and your rights
                    regarding refunds and returns.{" "}

                    (iii) The content used to create Digital Products and Hard
                    Products is provided by other users of the Site. We did not
                    create it, we do not preview it, and we have no control over
                    it. In short, we are not responsible for it or for any
                    shortcomings in it, including any intellectual property
                    infringement or other legal issues caused by it. Subject to
                    our Refunds and Returns policies referred to above, your
                    acquisition of Digital Products and Hard Products is at your

                    including the disclaimers and limitations of liability, also
                    apply specifically to the Digital Products, Hard Products

                    regarding the Marketplace.

                  <p>
                    Any dispute or claim by you arising out of or related to
                    this Agreement will be governed by North Carolina law,
                    exclusive of its choice of law rules.&nbsp; For any disputes
                    deemed not subject to binding individual arbitration, as
                    provided in the section immediately below, you and Epic
                    agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
                    Superior Court of Wake County, North Carolina, or, if
                    federal court jurisdiction exists, the United States
                    District Court for the Eastern District of North
                    Carolina.&nbsp; You and Epic agree to waive any
                    jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to
                    such courts (without affecting either party’s rights to
                    remove a case to federal court if permissible), as well as
                    any right to a jury trial.&nbsp; The Convention on Contracts
                    for the International Sale of Goods will not apply.&nbsp;
                    Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
                    contract shall be construed against the drafter will not
                    apply to this Agreement.&nbsp;This paragraph will be
                    interpreted as broadly as applicable law permits.
